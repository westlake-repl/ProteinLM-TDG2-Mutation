- There are two files in the Zenodo repository:
  - `esm2_t12_35M_UR50D_glycosylase.pt`: the checkpoint file for the trained model with the glycosylase dataset, where `esm2_t12_35M_UR50D` is the model name and `glycosylase` is the dataset name.
  - `esm2_t33_650M_UR50D_UNG.pt`: the checkpoint file for the trained model with the UNG dataset, where `esm2_t33_650M_UR50D` is the model name and `UNG` is the dataset name.
